This is the code for the project Theory of Sub-entropic Attention.
The code provided is a preliminary model that establishes the individual 
VOMM model fits fro all participants. 
The file "Bayes3par.py" is the main model file. To run it requires experiment data
This data is not updloaded as potential conflicts with GDPR seemed possible.
We are working on a solution that!
Running the file with experiment data, will return a csv with individual fits for
all particpints. It will also include some statistics for the posterior parameter
distribution
Furthermore a histrogram of the orders will be produced.
The also has a function "plot_running_accuracY" that produces both a model
and participant running average plot and overlays them. 

There is also provided a file "analyzer.py" that produces a runnning accuracy
plot for a participant.

The experiment code for psycopy is also provided

The csv provided is the model result for the 26 experiment participants who was part
in our project!
